| Determine which directory your R session is using as its current
| working directory using getwd().

> getwd()
[1] "C:/Users/ASUS/Documents/R_Project/datasciencecoursera"

| All that practice is paying off!

  |=====                                  |  13%
| List all the objects in your local workspace using ls().

> ls()
 [1] "chara"        "coerc1"       "columnBinded" "df"          
 [5] "FactorEx"     "List1"        "logical1"     "logical2"    
 [9] "m"            "matrices"     "Missingex"    "myfunction"  
[13] "numeric"      "RowBinded"    "Sequence_Vec" "Stringme"    
[17] "x"            "y"           

| All that practice is paying off!

  |======                                 |  15%
| Some R commands are the same as their equivalents commands on
| Linux or on a Mac. Both Linux and Mac operating systems are based
| on an operating system called Unix. It's always a good idea to
| learn more about Unix!

...

  |=======                                |  18%
| Assign 9 to x using x <- 9.

> x <- 9

| Keep up the great work!

  |========                               |  21%
| Now take a look at objects that are in your workspace using ls().

> ls()
 [1] "chara"        "coerc1"       "columnBinded" "df"          
 [5] "FactorEx"     "List1"        "logical1"     "logical2"    
 [9] "m"            "matrices"     "Missingex"    "myfunction"  
[13] "numeric"      "RowBinded"    "Sequence_Vec" "Stringme"    
[17] "x"            "y"           

| You're the best!

  |=========                              |  23%
| List all the files in your working directory using list.files()
| or dir().

> list.files()
[1] "datasciencecoursera.Rproj" "Helloworld.md"            
[3] "R_first_script.R"          "R_script_DataBasic.R"     
[5] "SwirlTask1.R"              "SwirlTask1.Rmd"           

| You got it!

  |==========                             |  26%
| As we go through this lesson, you should be examining the help
| page for each new function. Check out the help page for
| list.files with the command ?list.files.

> dir()
[1] "datasciencecoursera.Rproj" "Helloworld.md"            
[3] "R_first_script.R"          "R_script_DataBasic.R"     
[5] "SwirlTask1.R"              "SwirlTask1.Rmd"           

| Try again. Getting it right on the first try is boring anyway!
| Or, type info() for more options.

| Type ?list.files to see the help page.

> ?list.files

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |===========                            |  28%
| One of the most helpful parts of any R help file is the See Also
| section. Read that section for list.files. Some of these
| functions may be used in later portions of this lesson.

...

  |============                           |  31%
| Using the args() function on a function name is also a handy way
| to see what arguments a function can take.

...

  |=============                          |  33%
| Use the args() function to determine the arguments to
| list.files().

> args(list.files())
NULL

| Keep trying! Or, type info() for more options.

| Type args(list.files) to see the arguments to list.files.

> args(list.files)
function (path = ".", pattern = NULL, all.files = FALSE, 
    full.names = FALSE, recursive = FALSE, ignore.case = FALSE, 
    include.dirs = FALSE, no.. = FALSE) 
NULL

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |==============                         |  36%
| Assign the value of the current working directory to a variable
| called "old.dir".

> old.dir <- getwd()

| Keep up the great work!

  |===============                        |  38%
| We will use old.dir at the end of this lesson to move back to the
| place that we started. A lot of query functions like getwd() have
| the useful property that they return the answer to the question
| as a result of the function.

...

  |================                       |  41%
| Use dir.create() to create a directory in the current working
| directory called "testdir".

> dir.create("testdir")

| Keep up the great work!

  |=================                      |  44%
| We will do all our work in this new directory and then delete it
| after we are done. This is the R analog to "Take only pictures,
| leave only footprints."

...

  |==================                     |  46%
| Set your working directory to "testdir" with the setwd() command.

> setwd("testdir")

| You got it!

  |===================                    |  49%
| In general, you will want your working directory to be someplace
| sensible, perhaps created for the specific project that you are
| working on. In fact, organizing your work in R packages using
| RStudio is an excellent option. Check out RStudio at
| http://www.rstudio.com/

...

  |====================                   |  51%
| Create a file in your working directory called "mytest.R" using
| the file.create() function.

> file.create("mytest.R")
[1] TRUE

| You are really on a roll!

  |=====================                  |  54%
| This should be the only file in this newly created directory.
| Let's check this by listing all the files in the current
| directory.

> ls()
 [1] "chara"        "coerc1"       "columnBinded" "df"          
 [5] "FactorEx"     "List1"        "logical1"     "logical2"    
 [9] "m"            "matrices"     "Missingex"    "myfunction"  
[13] "numeric"      "old.dir"      "RowBinded"    "Sequence_Vec"
[17] "Stringme"     "x"            "y"           

| Try again. Getting it right on the first try is boring anyway!
| Or, type info() for more options.

| list.files() shows that the directory only contains mytest.R.

> list.files()
[1] "mytest.R"

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |======================                 |  56%
| Check to see if "mytest.R" exists in the working directory using
| the file.exists() function.

> file.exists("mytest.R")
[1] TRUE

| You are doing so well!

  |=======================                |  59%
| These sorts of functions are excessive for interactive use. But,
| if you are running a program that loops through a series of files
| and does some processing on each one, you will want to check to
| see that each exists before you try to process it.

...

  |========================               |  62%
| Access information about the file "mytest.R" by using
| file.info().

> 
> file.info("mytest.R")
         size isdir mode               mtime               ctime
mytest.R    0 FALSE  666 2020-06-13 09:27:08 2020-06-13 09:27:08
                       atime exe
mytest.R 2020-06-13 09:27:08  no

| Nice work!

  |=========================              |  64%
| You can use the $ operator --- e.g., file.info("mytest.R")$mode
| --- to grab specific items.

...

  |==========================             |  67%
| Change the name of the file "mytest.R" to "mytest2.R" by using file.rename().

> file.rename("mytest.R" , "mytest2.R")
[1] TRUE

| Excellent work!

  |===========================            |  69%
| Your operating system will provide simpler tools for these sorts of tasks, but having the ability to manipulate files programatically is
| useful. You might now try to delete mytest.R using file.remove('mytest.R'), but that won't work since mytest.R no longer exists. You have
| already renamed it.

...

  |============================           |  72%
| Make a copy of "mytest2.R" called "mytest3.R" using file.copy().

> file.copy("mytest2.R" , "mytest3.R")
[1] TRUE

| That's correct!

  |=============================          |  74%
| You now have two files in the current directory. That may not seem very interesting. But what if you were working with dozens, or millions,
| of individual files? In that case, being able to programatically act on many files would be absolutely necessary. Don't forget that you can,
| temporarily, leave the lesson by typing play() and then return by typing nxt().

...

  |==============================         |  77%
| Provide the relative path to the file "mytest3.R" by using file.path().

> file.path("mytest3.R")
[1] "mytest3.R"

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |===============================        |  79%
| You can use file.path to construct file and directory paths that are independent of the operating system your R code is running on. Pass
| 'folder1' and 'folder2' as arguments to file.path to make a platform-independent pathname.

> 
> f
Error: object 'f' not found
> file.path("folder1","folder2")
[1] "folder1/folder2"

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |================================       |  82%
| Take a look at the documentation for dir.create by entering ?dir.create . Notice the 'recursive' argument. In order to create nested
| directories, 'recursive' must be set to TRUE.

> ?dir

| One more time. You can do it! Or, type info() for more options.

| ?dir.create will show you the docs.

> ?dir.create

| Excellent work!

  |=================================      |  85%
| Create a directory in the current working directory called "testdir2" and a subdirectory for it called "testdir3", all in one command by
| using dir.create() and file.path().

> dir.cs
Error: object 'dir.cs' not found
> info
function () 
{
    swirl_out(s() %N% "When you are at the R prompt (>):")
    swirl_out(s() %N% "-- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.", 
        skip_before = FALSE)
    swirl_out(s() %N% "-- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what you do...", 
        skip_before = FALSE)
    swirl_out(s() %N% "-- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.", 
        skip_before = FALSE)
    swirl_out(s() %N% "-- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.", 
        skip_before = FALSE)
    swirl_out(s() %N% "-- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.", 
        skip_before = FALSE)
    swirl_out(s() %N% "-- Typing info() displays these options again.", 
        skip_before = FALSE, skip_after = TRUE)
    invisible()
}
<bytecode: 0x000001fa1d944aa0>
<environment: namespace:swirl>

| That's not exactly what I'm looking for. Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| dir.create(file.path('testdir2', 'testdir3'), recursive = TRUE) will do the trick. If you forgot the recursive argument,
| the command may have appeared to work, but it didn't create the nested directory.

> dir.create(file.path("testdir2","testdir3"),recursive = TRUE)

| Keep up the great work!

  |==================================     |  87%
| Go back to your original working directory using setwd(). (Recall that we created the variable old.dir with the full
| path for the orginal working directory at the start of these questions.)

> dir
function (path = ".", pattern = NULL, all.files = FALSE, 
    full.names = FALSE, recursive = FALSE, ignore.case = FALSE, 
    include.dirs = FALSE, no.. = FALSE) 
.Internal(list.files(path, pattern, all.files, full.names, recursive, 
    ignore.case, include.dirs, no..))
<bytecode: 0x000001fa161b2c80>
<environment: namespace:base>

| Keep trying! Or, type info() for more options.

| Use setwd(old.dir).

> dir()
[1] "mytest2.R" "mytest3.R" "testdir2" 

| You almost had it, but not quite. Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Use setwd(old.dir).

> setwd(old.dir)

| You are doing so well!

  |===================================    |  90%
| It is often helpful to save the settings that you had before you began an analysis and then go back to them at the end.
| This trick is often used within functions; you save, say, the par() settings that you started with, mess around a bunch,
| and then set them back to the original values at the end. This isn't the same as what we have done here, but it seems
| similar enough to mention.

...

  |====================================   |  92%
| After you finish this lesson delete the 'testdir' directory that you just left (and everything in it)

...

  |=====================================  |  95%
| Take nothing but results. Leave nothing but assumptions. That sounds like 'Take nothing but pictures. Leave nothing but
| footprints.' But it makes no sense! Surely our readers can come up with a better motto . . .

...

  |====================================== |  97%
| In this lesson, you learned how to examine your R workspace and work with the file system of your machine from within R.
| Thanks for playing!
