| In this lesson, we'll see how to extract elements from a vector based on some conditions that we specify.

...

  |===                                                                                                              |   3%
| For example, we may only be interested in the first 20 elements of a vector, or only the elements that are not NA, or
| only those that are positive or correspond to a specific variable of interest. By the end of this lesson, you'll know
| how to handle each of these scenarios.

...

  |======                                                                                                           |   5%
| I've created for you a vector called x that contains a random ordering of 20 numbers (from a standard normal
| distribution) and 20 NAs. Type x now to see what it looks like.

[37]          NA  0.70895275  0.04580582          NA

| That's correct!

  |=========                                                                                                        |   8%
| The way you tell R that you want to select some particular elements (i.e. a 'subset') from a vector is by placing an
| 'index vector' in square brackets immediately following the name of the vector.

...

  |============                                                                                                     |  10%
| For a simple example, try x[1:10] to view the first ten elements of x.

> x[1:10]
 [1]          NA          NA -0.87166940 -0.44522646 -1.14853136 -0.10440233 -0.06583738  0.25611843  0.35004298
[10]          NA

  |==============                                                                                                   |  13%
| Index vectors come in four different flavors -- logical vectors, vectors of positive integers, vectors of negative
| integers, and vectors of character strings -- each of which we'll cover in this lesson.

...

  |=================                                                                                                |  15%
| Let's start by indexing with logical vectors. One common scenario when working with real-world data is that we want to
| extract all elements of a vector that are not NA (i.e. missing data). Recall that is.na(x) yields a vector of logical
| values the same length as x, with TRUEs corresponding to NA values in x and FALSEs corresponding to non-NA values in x.

...

  |====================                                                                                             |  18%
| What do you think x[is.na(x)] will give you?

1: A vector of length 0
2: A vector with no NAs
3: A vector of all NAs
4: A vector of TRUEs and FALSEs

Selection: 2

| You almost had it, but not quite. Try again.

| Remember that is.na(x) tells us where the NAs are in a vector. So if we subset x based on that, what do you expect to
| happen?

1: A vector of length 0
2: A vector with no NAs
3: A vector of all NAs
4: A vector of TRUEs and FALSEs

Selection: 4

| That's not exactly what I'm looking for. Try again.

| Remember that is.na(x) tells us where the NAs are in a vector. So if we subset x based on that, what do you expect to
| happen?

1: A vector with no NAs

4: A vector of TRUEs and FALSEs

Selection: 3

| You got it right!

  |=======================                                                                                          |  21%
| Prove it to yourself by typing x[is.na(x)].

> x[is.na(x)]
 [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

| Excellent job!

  |==========================                                                                                       |  23%
| Recall that `!` gives us the negation of a logical expression, so !is.na(x) can be read as 'is not NA'. Therefore, if we
| want to create a vector called y that contains all of the non-NA values from x, we can use y <- x[!is.na(x)]. Give it a
| try.

> y <- x[!is.na(x)]

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |=============================                                                                                    |  26%
| Print y to the console.

| Now that we've isolated the non-missing values of x and put them in y, we can subset y as we please.

...

  |===================================                                                                              |  31%
| Recall that the expression y > 0 will give us a vector of logical values the same length as y, with TRUEs corresponding
| to values of y that are greater than zero and FALSEs corresponding to values of y that are less than or equal to zero.
| What do you think y[y > 0] will give you?

1: A vector of all the negative elements of y
2: A vector of all the positive elements of y
3: A vector of TRUEs and FALSEs
4: A vector of length 0
5: A vector of all NAs

Selection: 2

| You got it!

  |======================================                                                                           |  33%
| Type y[y > 0] to see that we get all of the positive elements of y, which are also the positive elements of our original
| vector x.

| You might wonder why we didn't just start with x[x > 0] to isolate the positive elements of x. Try that now to see why.

> x[x>0]

| Excellent work!

  |===========================================                                                                      |  38%
| Since NA is not a value, but rather a placeholder for an unknown quantity, the expression NA > 0 evaluates to NA. Hence
| we get a bunch of NAs mixed in with our positive numbers when we do this.

...

  |==============================================                                                                   |  41%
| Combining our knowledge of logical operators with our new knowledge of subsetting, we could do this -- x[!is.na(x) & x >
| 0]. Try it out.

> x[!is.na(x) & x > 0]

| You are doing so well!

  |=================================================                                                                |  44%
| In this case, we request only values of x that are both non-missing AND greater than zero.

...

  |====================================================                                                             |  46%
| I've already shown you how to subset just the first ten values of x using x[1:10]. In this case, we're providing a
| vector of positive integers inside of the square brackets, which tells R to return only the elements of x numbered 1
| through 10.

...

  |=======================================================                                                          |  49%
| Many programming languages use what's called 'zero-based indexing', which means that the first element of a vector is
| considered element 0. R uses 'one-based indexing', which (you guessed it!) means the first element of a vector is
| considered element 1.

...

  |==========================================================                                                       |  51%
| Can you figure out how we'd subset the 3rd, 5th, and 7th elements of x? Hint -- Use the c() function to specify the
| element numbers as a numeric vector.

> x[c(3,5,7)]
[1] -0.87166940 -1.14853136 -0.06583738

| You got it right!

  |=============================================================                                                    |  54%
| It's important that when using integer vectors to subset our vector x, we stick with the set of indexes {1, 2, ..., 40}
| since x only has 40 elements. What happens if we ask for the zeroth element of x (i.e. x[0])? Give it a try.

> x[0]
numeric(0)

| You are amazing!

  |================================================================                                                 |  56%
| As you might expect, we get nothing useful. Unfortunately, R doesn't prevent us from doing this. What if we ask for the
| 3000th element of x? Try it out.

> x[3000]
[1] NA

| Nice work!

  |===================================================================                                              |  59%
| Again, nothing useful, but R doesn't prevent us from asking for it. This should be a cautionary tale. You should always
| make sure that what you are asking for is within the bounds of the vector you're working with.

...

  |======================================================================                                           |  62%
| What if we're interested in all elements of x EXCEPT the 2nd and 10th? It would be pretty tedious to construct a vector
| containing all numbers 1 through 40 EXCEPT 2 and 10.

...

  |========================================================================                                         |  64%
| Luckily, R accepts negative integer indexes. Whereas x[c(2, 10)] gives us ONLY the 2nd and 10th elements of x, x[c(-2,
| -10)] gives us all elements of x EXCEPT for the 2nd and 10 elements.  Try x[c(-2, -10)] now to see this.

> c(-2,10)
[1] -2 10

| Not exactly. Give it another go. Or, type info() for more options.

| Give x[c(-2, -10)] a try.

| So far, we've covered three types of index vectors -- logical, positive integer, and negative integer. The only
| remaining type requires us to introduce the concept of 'named' elements.

...

  |=================================================================================                                |  72%
| Create a numeric vector with three named elements using vect <- c(foo = 11, bar = 2, norf = NA).

> vect <- c(foo = 11, bar =2,norf = NA)

| That's a job well done!

  |====================================================================================                             |  74%
| When we print vect to the console, you'll see that each element has a name. Try it out.

> vect
 foo  bar norf 
  11    2   NA 

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |=======================================================================================                          |  77%
| We can also get the names of vect by passing vect as an argument to the names() function. Give that a try.

> names(vect)
[1] "foo"  "bar"  "norf"

| You are really on a roll!

  |==========================================================================================                       |  79%
| Alternatively, we can create an unnamed vector vect2 with c(11, 2, NA). Do that now.

> vect2<-c(11,2,NA)

| Great job!

  |=============================================================================================                    |  82%
| Then, we can add the `names` attribute to vect2 after the fact with names(vect2) <- c("foo", "bar", "norf"). Go ahead.

> names(vect2) <- C("foo","bar","norf")
Error in C("foo", "bar", "norf") : object not interpretable as a factor
> names(vect2) <- c("foo","bar","norf")

| You got it!

  |================================================================================================                 |  85%
| Now, let's check that vect and vect2 are the same by passing them as arguments to the identical() function.

> identical(vect,vect2)
[1] TRUE

| You're the best!

  |===================================================================================================              |  87%
| Indeed, vect and vect2 are identical named vectors.

...

  |=====================================================================================================            |  90%
| Now, back to the matter of subsetting a vector by named elements. Which of the following commands do you think would
| give us the second element of vect?

1: vect[bar]
2: vect["2"]
3: vect["bar"]

Selection: 3

| You are really on a roll!

  |========================================================================================================         |  92%
| Now, try it out.

> vect["bar"]
bar 
  2 

| Excellent job!

  |===========================================================================================================      |  95%
| Likewise, we can specify a vector of names with vect[c("foo", "bar")]. Try it out.

> 
> vect[c("foo","bar")]
foo bar 
 11   2 

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |==============================================================================================================   |  97%
| Now you know all four methods of subsetting data from vectors. Different approaches are best in different scenarios and
| when in doubt, try it out!
